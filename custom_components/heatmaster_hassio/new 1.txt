Despite multiple visits to your dealership and your team taking a look at the issue, my car still has not been repaired after 8 months. I understand that fixing a complex issue can take time, but this is an unreasonable amount of time for a luxury car that is only one year old. I have been patient and understanding throughout this process, but I feel that my patience has been exhausted.


I would like to emphasize that I do not wish to escalate this matter to CAMVAP or any other external agency. I trust that you will take immediate action to address the issue with my car and provide me with a clear timeline for when it will be fixed. As a loyal customer, I believe that I deserve prompt attention and a resolution to this matter.


I would appreciate if you could please take this matter seriously and provide me with a satisfactory solution. I hope we can resolve this issue promptly so that I can continue to enjoy driving my luxury car.


Thank you for your attention to this matter.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]
