Thank you for your prompt response. However, I am disappointed to hear that there is nothing you can do about the issue with my car. As a long-time customer of your dealership, I expected a more satisfactory response.


I believe that my car has a serious issue that needs to be addressed, and I have been patient and understanding throughout the process. However, after 8 months of trying to fix the issue, I am left with a luxury car that is still not functioning properly. I have invested a significant amount of money in this vehicle, and I expect it to meet the standards of quality and reliability that come with owning a luxury car.


I would like to request that you escalate this matter to your management team or another appropriate authority within your dealership. I am certain that a solution can be found if the right people are involved in the process. I also believe that it is in the best interest of your dealership to resolve this matter to maintain the trust and loyalty of your customers.


I am still hopeful that we can come to a satisfactory solution and avoid any legal action. However, if the matter is not resolved, I will have no choice but to take further action to protect my investment.


I look forward to your prompt response and resolution to this matter.


Sincerely,


[Your Name]
